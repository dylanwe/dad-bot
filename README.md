# dad-bot
 A fun little project that I made with Node.JS
 
## Functions
 When the bot is online you can type the command `!joke` which will pull a joke from https://icanhazdadjoke.com/ and display it in the chat like so:
 ![joke](img/joke.png)

 When someone types a string containing I'm or simular it will create the typical `Hey blank I'm Dad` joke.
